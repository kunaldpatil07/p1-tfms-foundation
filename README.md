P1-Trainee Feedback Management System This is a project to provide the rating for the trainer based on his/her batch and according to question section. My module is Question Management from the entire project. In this module you can log in as an admin only and have the functionality to add a question into the database and list them. I've implemented all the user stories mentioned into the common backlog. Such as, as admin I should be able to add questions into my database, with additional functionalities of editing and deleting a question from my database using front-end. Technologies used to achieve this module are Core Java, JDBC, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Servlets, JSP for the module. To set up the project you need Eclipse latest version and MySQL 8.0.31. Tables should be created in order to access jdbc functionalities and operations. One can use this project to provide a rating system for the trainer and teachers over any teaching platforms or schools and colleges to get a smooth user user experience and get a better idea about the changes to be made. The contributiors for this module are myself for now,as the module will progress and merge with other modules the contributiors will be listed accordingly.
